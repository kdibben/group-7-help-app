            <div class="underline">

            </div>
            <p>The local Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. (H.E.L.P.) is a Lifeline Program Partner with Philips
                Lifeline. HELP buys and then leases equipment to subscribers within Nodaway County to use to signal when
                a medical emergency occurs. Knowing that emergency assistance is available with the push of a button
                allows subscribers to remain in their own home and maintain an independent lifestyle.</p>
            <h4>Our Shared Purpose</h4>
            <p>Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. (HELP) is an all-volunteer organization providing Lifeline&trade;
                technology to community members living in Nodaway County and designated adjacent communities.</p>
            <h4>Our Mission</h4>
            <p>As volunteers we strive to provide dependable and reliable services linking subscribers to an emergency
                response center in case of a health emergency through appropriate technology at reasonable cost thereby
                allowing the subscriber to remain independently in the comfort and safety of their personal residence.

                        <p>As an all-volunteer organization, Lifeline services are provided by Nodaway County community
                            members who find fulfillment in serving their neighbors in need.</p>

                        <h4>Emergency Response at the Touch of a Button</h4>
                        <p>With the touch of a button, a Lifeline subscriber is connected to central monitoring staff
                            that assess the emergency and quickly send the appropriate assistance, 24 hours a day, 7
                            days a week, even on holidays. Lifeline subscribers remain at home, leading more comfortable
                            and fulfilling lives.</p>

                        <h4>AutoAlert Button Available – Includes Fall Protection</h4>
                        <p>The AutoAlert help button worn on the outside of the subscriber’s clothing, detects a fall by
                            the velocity of the swing of this button during the fall. Central Monitoring, following a
                            fall, monitors for approximately 30 seconds. If the subscriber is not able to get up,
                            Central Monitoring sends a call for help. Subscribers with the AutoAlert may select to have
                            EMTs dispatched immediately or to have a family member or other personal responder come
                            first.</p>

                        <p>Lifeline subscribers select normally three individuals to serve as responders in case of an
                            emergency. That caring support comes from neighbors, family members or friends chosen by the
                            subscriber.</p>

                        <h4>Affordable Monthly Subscriber Fee</h4>
                        <p>
                            Program equipment is purchased from Philips Lifeline by HELP. HELP leases the equipment to
                            subscribers. Installation and service calls are free. The monthly lease cost to subscribers
                            is reasonable and considerably less than similar programs operated through the United
                            States. Enrolled subscribers pay a reasonable monthly fee which covers the cost of Central
                            Monitoring fees and minimal administrative costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Keeping costs low is an important feature
                            of the HELP program. Automatic bank payment is preferred. For specific fees, see “Contact
                            Info/Fees” elsewhere in this website. HELP has consistently received funding from the local
                            United Way, Nodaway County Senior Tax Board, and various service groups throughout the
                            county to provide units to subscribers with modest means. HELP has also been assisted by The
                            Gladys Rickard Trust with funds to purchase the communication units and accessories.
